<h1>Before starting the course</h1>

<p>
    First, let's make sure the setup of your environment is ok.
</p>

<h2>Main method</h2>
<p>
    This method is sometimes added so you can play around with the assignment without having to rely on test output.

    </p>
<p>
    Try to execute the main method by pressing on the green arrow to its left.

    <img src="main-run.png"/><br/>
</p>
<b>If the green arrow is not present</b>
<p>
    There can be various reasons why the green arrow is not showing:
    <ul>
    <li>you need to install the Kotlin plugin. If you do not know how, ask an instructor (or the person next to you).</li>
</ul>

    But, if the Kotlin plugin is already present, then there is a high likely hood of there being a gradle issue.
    <ul>
        <li>Open the gradle tool window on the right</li>
        <li>first press 'refresh'</li>
        <li>if that goes well, then 'execute gradle task' > popup window >  type 'clean build'</li>
    </ul>

    There will probably be an error message in one of the steps, which could help you on your way.
</p>

<h2>Check task - step one</h2>
<p>
    This is used to validate your assignment. It will kick off various Tests and inform you about the result.
</p>
<p>
    Click on the box-checkmark icon in the top of this Task Description. It
    should try to kick off the tests.
    However, in this case it <b>should</b> return <b>Compilation failure</b>!
    <br/><img src="check-task.png"/><br/>
</p>

<h2>Check task - placeholder</h2>
<p>
    Some assignments have <b>placeholders</b>, which indicate what to fill in where in the task.
</p>
<p>
    To make the currentcheck work, you have to fill in the <b>placeholder</b> in the task.

    Type "<b>TestMe</b>" (without the quotes) in the placeholder, and run the 'check task' again.<br/>
    <img src="placeholder.png"/><br/>

    When running "check task", it should now report <b>Congratulations!</b>.
    This means the placeholder was filled in correctly.
</p>
