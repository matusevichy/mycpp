<h1>Unit testing</h1>
<p>Let's turn things around! We have some code we need to cover with our tests. </p>
<p>The common structure of a test file looks like this: </p>
<pre>
    <code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
class Test {

    @Before
    fun setup() {
        // Everything you like to do before each test has run
    }

    @After
    fun teardown() {
          // Everything you like to do after each test has run
    }

    @Test
    fun a_should_be_equal_to_a() {
        val expected = "a"
        val actual = "a"

        assertEquals(expected, actual, "Should return equal")
    }

}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>A test framework will call each function annotated with <code>@Test</code>. Each function tries to test an assertion.
</p>
<p>Complete the unit tests to test <code>UserRepository</code>.</p>
