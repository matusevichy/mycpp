<h1>List</h1>

<p>
    A list is not created using a constructor, but through the method <code>listOf()</code>. E.g.
</p>

<pre><code>
    val myList = listOf(1,3,4)
</code></pre>

<p>
    However, the standard List in Kotlin is immutable. Which means methods to add and remove elements
    do not exist. Once the List is created, its objects cannot be added or removed.
</p>

<p>
    To create a mutable list, you use the method <code>mutableListOf()</code>. The result is a List that
    <b>does</b> have the methods to add and remove elements
</p>


<p>
    Standard operations on a List are as following (note: list indices, start at 0)
</p>
<pre><code>
    val myList = mutableListOf("A" , "B" , "C" )
    var item = myList[1]  // get the 2nd item == "B"
    myList.size //returns the number of elements


    //only when mutable
    myList[1] = "X"  //replace the 2nd item, only when mutable
    item = myList[1] // == "X"
    myList.remove("X") // remove "X" from List
    myList.removeAt(0) // remove whatever is at index 0
    myList.clear() //remove all elements
</code></pre>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
    There are two methods: one receiving a <b>mutable</b> List, the other an <b>immutable</b> List.

    Both methods should return an immutable list that has the following changes:
<ul>

    <li>
        change the third item to "d"
    </li>
    <li>
        remove the second item
    </li>
</ul>
But only perform these actions if the indices are present.

But, you say, I can't change an immutable list! You can however create an mutable list from
a immutable list, using the <code>toMutableList()</code> method.

Bonus questions:
<ul><li>When creating a mutable list using <code>toMutableList</code>, do operations on the
new list influence the old?</li>
<li>If the mutable list is assigned to a <code>val</code>, can you still add/remove items?</li>
</ul>
