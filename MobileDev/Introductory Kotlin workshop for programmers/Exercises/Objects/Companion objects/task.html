<h1>Companion Object</h1>
<p>Object declaration inside a class can be marked with the <b>companion</b> keyword.</p>
<p>The nice thing about a <code>Companion</code> object is that the functions or values declared inside it will look like they are part of the class it accompanies.</p>
<pre>
    <code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
      class SomeClass {

        companion object CompanionObject {
            fun doSomething(){
                println("something")
            }
        }
      }
      val x = SomeClass.doSomething()
      val actualCompanionObject = SomeClass.CompanionObject
    </code></pre>

<p>We don't even have to name the companion object:</p>
<pre>
    <code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
      class SomeClass {
        companion object {
            fun doSomething(){
                println("something")
            }
        }
      }
      val x = SomeClass.doSomething()
      val actualCompanionObject = SomeClass.Companion
    </code></pre>
<p></p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
    One use case of a <b><code>companion</code></b> object could be an implementation of the factory pattern.
</p>
<p>
    The factory’s goal is to deliver a ready-to-use object to its client. The factory hides the complexity of creating
    and selecting the right object for the job.
</p>

<p>Now it's time for you to create a companion object. </p>

<p>
    You know exactly what a <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Plumbus">plumbus</a> is and how it’s used. Now we
     will create a <b><code>PlumbusFactory</code></b>! The factory will create simple Plumbuses, assign each one an id,
    and count how many have been made.
</p>

<p>
    There currently is a Plumbus class with a private constructor (so no one create his own home-grown Plumbus). It
    is your job to add a companion object by the name <b><code>PlumbusFactory</code></b>. This factory has two things:
    <ol>
      <li>A <b><code>count</code></b> property indicating how many Plumbuses have been created.</li>
      <li>A <b><code>create()</code></b> function, which increments the <code>count</code> and returns a fresh Plumbus with an id that is equivalent
      to the new count/</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    To get an idea what it will look like when used: see the commented out code in the main method.
