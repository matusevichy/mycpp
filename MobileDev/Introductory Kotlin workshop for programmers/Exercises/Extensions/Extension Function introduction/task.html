Extension Functions
To declare an extension function, we need to prefix its name with a receiver type,
    i.e. the type being extended.
    The following adds a prefix function to <b>String</b>:
</p>

    <code>
    fun String.prefix() = "prefix> $this"
    </code>

    <p>
        The this keyword inside an extension function corresponds to the receiver object (the one that is passed before the dot). Now, we can call such a function on any String:
    </p>


<code>
    "my great string".prefix()
</code>
<p>
and this will return
</p>
<pre>
prefix> my great string
</pre>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

Create a <b>hello()</b> extension function for String that will return "hello xyz", where "xyz" was the original string.
