<h1>Contravariance</h1>

<h2>What does this mean</h2>

Contravariance means that the following is possible:

<pre>
    class Dog
    class DanishDog:Dog

    val dogTrainer : Trainer&lt;Dog&gt; = Trainer&lt;Dog&gt;()
    val danishDogTrainer : Trainer&lt;DanishDog&gt; = dogTrainer
</pre>

In other words: the ordering of the generic is <b>contra</b> to the ordering of the generic type.
When <code>DanishDog</code> extends <code>Dog</code>, <code>Trainer&lt;Dog&gt;</code> can be considered to
extend <code>Trainer&lt;DanishDog&gt;</code>.

<h2>Why would we want this?</h2>

<p>
    Let's say you have a class <code>Trainer&lt;T&gt;</code>: and it has only methods that consume <code>T</code>,
    and there are no methods that return <code>T</code>. In this case contravariance could be desired,
    because the methods that consume the superclass, will have no problem consuming the subclass.
</p>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
    abstract class Dog(val name:String)
    class DanishDog(name:String):Dog(name)

    interface Trainer&lt;T&gt;{
        fun train(target:T)
    }

    val dogTrainer = object:Trainer&lt;Dog&gt;{
        override fun train(target:Dog) {
            println("Dog ${target.name} is trained")
        }
    }

    val danishDogTrainer:Trainer&lt;DanishDog&gt; = dogTrainer
</pre>
<p>
    In this example it shoukd not be a problem to cast the dogTrainer to the danishDogTrainer. This is because it has only
    methods consuming T, and when such a method process Dog, it has no problem processing a DanishDog.
</p>
<p>
    If you have a class as described above, with only methods that have <code>T</code> as an argument and no
    methods returning <code>T</code>, we call this a <b>consumer</b>.
</p>

<h2>How to make a class contravariant?</h2>

Making a class contravariant, in other words, having <code>Trainer&lt;Dog&gt;</code> to be considered
extending <code>Trainer&lt;DanishDog&gt;</code>, requires you to add the keyword <b>in</b>

<pre>
    class Trainer&lt;<b>in</b> T&gt;{
        fun train(target:T)
    }

</pre>
If you don't add <b>in</b>, kotlin will keep considering the class invariant.
Be aware however that you can only add <b>in</b> to classes that have <b>NO methods that return T!</b>


<h2>Assignment</h2>

The current class is not contravariant. Make it so that it can and will be contravariant:
<ul>
    <li>Make the class a consumer: remove all producer methods</li>
    <li>Add the right keyword</li>
    <li>Eventually assign a generic dog trainer to a danish dog trainer to showcase the contravariance</li>
</ul>
