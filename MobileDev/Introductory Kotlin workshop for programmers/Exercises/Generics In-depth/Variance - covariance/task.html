<h1>Covariance</h1>

<h2>What does this mean</h2>

Covariance means that the following is possible:

<pre>
    val dogCarrier : Carrier&lt;Dog&gt; = Carrier(Dog())
    val animalCarrier : Carrier&lt;Animal&gt; = dogCarrier
</pre>

In other words: the ordering of the generic follows the ordering of the generic type.
When <code>Dog</code> extends <code>Animal</code>, <code>Carrier&lt;Dog&gt;</code> can be considered to
extend <code>Carrier&lt;Animal&gt;</code>.

<h2>Why would we want this?</h2>

<p>
    Let's say you have a class <code>Carrier&lt;T&gt;</code>: and it has only methods that return <code>T</code>,
    and there are no methods that have <code>T</code> as their arguments. In this case covariance would be desired,
    because there would be no possibility, as by our example, to provide an <code>Animal</code> to
    a <code>dogCarrier</code>.
</p>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
    class Carrier&lt;T&gt;(private val thing: T){
        fun getThing():T = thing
    }


    val dogCarrier : Carrier&lt;Dog&gt; = Carrier(Dog())
    val animalCarrier: Carrier&lt;Animal&gt; = dogCarrier

    val animal:Animal = animalCarrier.getThing()  //not a problem
    // and there are no methods in Carrier with argument T

</pre>
<p>
    If you have a class as described above, with only methods returning <code>T</code> and no
    methods with <code>T</code> as argument, we call this a <b>producer</b>.
</p>

<h2>How to make a class covariant?</h2>

Making a class covariant, in other words, having <code>Carrier&lt;Dog&gt;</code> to be considered
extending <code>Carrier&lt;Animal&gt;</code>, requires you to add the keyword <b>out</b>

<pre>
    class Carrier&lt;<b>out</b> T&gt;(private val thing: T){
        fun getThing():T = thing
    }
</pre>
If you don't add <b>out</b>, kotlin will keep considering the class invariant.
Be aware however that you can only add <b>out</b> to classes that have <b>NO methods with T as argument !</b>


<h2>Assignment</h2>

The current class is not covariant. Make it so that it can and will be covariant:
<ul>
    <li>Make the class a producer: remove all consumer methods</li>
    <li>Add the right keyword</li>
    <li>And eventually assign a dog carrier to an animal carrier</li>
</ul>
