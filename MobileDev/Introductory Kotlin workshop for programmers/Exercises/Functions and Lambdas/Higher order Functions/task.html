<h1>Higher Order Functions</h1>

<p>
    Higher order functions (<b>HOF</b>), is an expensive way of saying <blockquote>A function that has a function as a parameter</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
    Since functions are first-class citizens in Kotlin, you can pass functions around as parameters.
</p>

<p>
    Just as a regular parameter: to have a function as a parameter, you have to define its type.
    The type of a function is defined in the following form:
</p>
<pre>
    (A , B) -&gt; C
</pre>
<p>
    This specifies the signature of the expected function. Between parentheses, you specify its parameter types (<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>). After the <b>-&gt;</b> you define its return type (<b>C</b>).
</p>
<p>
    Functions that have no parameters are specified using empty braces, e.g. <b>() -&gt; C</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Functions that have no return value are always specified with the type Unit, e.g. <b>(Int, Int) -&gt; Unit</b>
</p>

<p>
    An example of a function definition of a higher order function:
</p>


<pre><code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
    fun theHoff( kittWristwatch: (String)->Boolean ){
        println("Kitt, execute!")
        val isSuccess = kittWristwatch("IncreaseSizeOfShark")

        if( isSuccess ) {
            println("Thanks Kitt!")
        } else {
            println("xâ¸‘x")
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    So, theHoff is expected a function he calls 'kittWristwatch'. This function should expect
    a String and should return a Boolean.
</p>
<p>
    A call to theHoff looks as follows
</p>

<pre><code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
    val brokenWristwatch:(String) -> Boolean = { command:String ->
        println("Sorry, I can't do that Michael")
        false
    }

    theHoff( brokenWristwatch )

</code></pre>

<p>
    Off course, this can be shortened by applying the lambda directly:
</p>


<pre><code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
    theHoff{ command ->
        println("Sorry, I can't do that Michael")
        false
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    <b>Notice the absence of braces.</b> If the lambda is the only argument to that call, the parentheses can be omitted entirely.
</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
    Now for the assignment we want you to write a Stopwatch object.
    The Stopwatch object has a method which will measure the execution time of a given function.
</p>
<p>
    It has the following requirements, it:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>is named "elapse"</li>
    <li>will execute the given function. The given function should not expect any parameters nor have any output (=Unit)</li>
    <li>will return a the duration of that function in ms as a Long</li>
</ul>

</html>
<div class='hint'> Use 'System.currentTimeMillis()' for getting the current time.</div>
