<h1>Platform types</h1>
<p>Any reference in Java may be null, which makes Kotlin's requirements of strict null-safety impractical for objects coming from Java.
    Types of Java declarations are treated specially in Kotlin and called <b>platform types. </b></p>
<p>A platform type is indicated by IntelliJ with an <b>exlamation mark (!)</b></p>

<p>
    When you receive a reference from a java call, you can choose to treat it as a nullable or non-nullable.
    When you assign the reference to a non-nullable variable, an assertion will take place.
</p>

<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre><code>
    val resultA = someJavaCall() //result is a platform type

    resultA.someMethod() //throws NullPointerException if resultA is null

    val resultB:String = someJavaCall() //will throw IllegalStateException if result is null
    val resultC:String? = someJavaCall() //result is considered a nullable reference

</code></pre>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
Create a wrapper for the Java <code>receiveMail</code> method. Make sure it never returns null, but an
empty list at best.
</p>
<p>
    Note: to create an empty list, use <code>listOf()</code>
</p>
