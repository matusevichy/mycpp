<h1>Variables</h1>

Kotlin has two type of keywords to define variable declarations:
<ul>
    <li><b>val</b> - can only be assigned once</li>
    <li><b>var</b> - can be re-assigned </li>
</ul>


<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>
Example of declaring a variable:
</p>
<pre><code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
    var myVariable:Int = 123
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the type of the variable is <b>after</b> the variable name, seperated by a colon (:).</p>
<p>Types can be inferred, so the following is allowed as well:</p>

<pre><code data-lang="text/x-kotlin">
    var myVariable = 123
</code></pre>

<p>Kotlin will infer that <b>myVariable</b> is of type Int</p>

<p>
    Variables can be declared inside functions, as well as outside. The latter called 'top-level' variables.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
In this task the class <b>MyTask</b> will be instantiated a <b>maxNumberOfTasks</b> times.
At each instantiation <b>printTask</b> will be invoked.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do to make this work is to make sure of the following
</p>
<ul>
    <li>maxNumberOfTasks is read only</li>
    <li>numberOfTasks can be reassigned a new value</li>
</ul>
